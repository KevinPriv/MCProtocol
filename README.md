# MCProtocol
This project implements the current Minecraft protocol in Java. Might give up on this some day.

This entire project is just a little challenge for me to get away from boredom.
I try to improve my code quality, make my code modular, apply design patterns and other concepts.

## Current Features
- Fetch MOTD
- Login to servers
- Send packets/chat
- Easy to extend

## Roadmap
- World/chunk management
- Player movement/more action
- More packets implemented.
- Tests & code inspection
- Cleaner and more quality code
